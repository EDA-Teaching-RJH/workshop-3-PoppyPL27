Weekday = input("what day of the week is it? ")

if Weekday == "saturday" or Weekday == "sunday":
    print("its the weekend!")
else:
    print("its a weekday!")

# this will say its  weekday if you enter anything other than saturday pr sunday. this is a fault in this code. 
# it will even say its a weekday if you use a capital letter to spell saturday or sunday
